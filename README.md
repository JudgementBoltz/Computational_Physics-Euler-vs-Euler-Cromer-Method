##Euler-vs-Euler-Cromer-Method

Consider the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator.<br>
In this case we consider a pendulum of length <i>l</i> in a gravitational field <i>g</i>:

This project applies the Euler and Euler-Cromer methods to compute θ and ω vs. time t and compares a plot of θ vs. t over a few periods for the two methods.
